    <h2>Target Market</h2>
    <p>
      Ideal market at the moment will be any person who uses cloud services like email, drive/docs, photos and want to reduce their cloud storage for a better cloud experience. For example, not missing important emails and not paying extra for more cloud storage. There are many cloud providers. We will first focus on users of Google cloud.
    </p>

    <h2>Market Size and Opportunity</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/en/en-it/2025/03/30/MUSKDRFUU5DNHDNYNMPGFQKWCE/">Chosun Biz</a> estimates that there are 16 million plus users of Gmail in South Korea as of 03.30.2025. If even 1% of these 16 million plus users fits the description of the Target Market, then that’s 160,000 potential customers. At our service’s current one time fee of ₩2,400, there is a potential market opportunity of ₩384,000,000 if 1% of South Korean Google users use our Cleaner Cloud Suite one time. The market size will continually grow as more users fill up their Google cloud storage. Note that right now for Google users in Korea the price per 100 GB of extra cloud storage is ₩2,400 per month.
    </p>

    <h2>Business Model</h2>
    <p>
      The company will earn revenue from one-time purchases or subscriptions of the Cleaner Cloud Suite/Photos/Drive/Email product. The company will also earn revenue every time someone uses the Cleaner Cloud Service. See Home page and Process page for more details on the suite and service.
    </p>

    <h2>Traction and Validation</h2>
    <p>
      Current traction and validation is based on personal conversations with users of cloud services, many of whom have had to pay for extra storage, have been blocked from using cloud services because they’ve hit their storage limit, and have missed important emails. There are also countless forums with questions about how to clean up one's cloud, plus articles with tips on how to manually clean up your cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some products already on the market that do something similar to Cleaner Cloud, especially Cleaner Cloud Email. One mature product available today is <a href="https://www.sanebox.com/home"></a>SaneBox</a> that aims to clean up your email inboxes using a machine learning algorithm. I am currently trying out the product on my own mailbox. I can tell that it doesn’t take into account the fact that some users may never delete their emails. For such users (such as myself!) Sanebox will have poor performance. This is why Cleaner Cloud Suite asks customers to provide fresh training data. See Process page for more details.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another competitor is of course Google Gemini, which I have also been using in my Google email and drive. One can easily bulk select and delete emails from a certain sender with Gemini, however Gemini doesn’t take into account what emails should or should not be deleted. Furthermore, it looks like Gemini can summarize at most only 6 emails at a time. Also it’s important to point out that Google has little incentive to clean up your cloud since it makes money on users buying more storage.

    <h2>Financial Projections</h2>
    <p>
      In 1 year’s time we plan to have developed programs and apps that can be used and distributed widely to hit 160,000 downloads or ₩384,000,000 in revenue.
    </p>

    <h2>Funding Request</h2>
    <p>
      In the first year we will need ₩200,000,000 to pay the salaries of 2 more full time employees. With the current CEO and these 2 additional employees, the team will have product, computer science, data science, IT help desk, and customer service skills. We also need ₩20,000,000 won for hardware, software, and marketing costs. Total funding request: ₩220,000,000
