      <h2>Cleaner Cloud Suite</h2>

        <li>
          Pay the one time fee of ₩2,400 for a one time cleanup, or subscribe ₩2,400/month for unlimited cleanup.
        </li>
        <li>
          After purchasing the suite (or single products within the suite), you will be able to download the program.
        </li>
        <li>
          After downloading, open the program. It will take you to an annotation GUI where you will be asked to label randomly chosen emails, files, photos as “delete” or “keep”. This labelled data will serve as fresh training data for the suite’s machine learning algorithm.
        </li>
        <li>
          The machine learning algorithm will then be further tuned with the freshly labelled data you provided. It will then recommend emails, files, photos that can be deleted in bulk.
        </li>
        <li>
          The suite will also give you AI generated summaries in text or reel format of what will be deleted.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you approve these summaries, the suite will clean up your cloud!
